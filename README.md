# NBA Trends

In this project, you’ll analyze data from the NBA (National Basketball Association) and explore possible associations.

This data was originally sourced from 538’s Analysis of the [Complete History Of The NBA](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/complete-history-of-the-nba/#warriors) and contains the original, unmodified data from [Basketball Reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/) as well as several additional variables 538 added to perform their own analysis.

You can read more about the data and how it’s being used by 538 [here](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/nba-elo). For this project we’ve limited the data to just 5 teams and 10 columns (plus one constructed column, point_diff, the difference between pts and opp_pts).

You will create several charts and tables in this project, so you’ll need to use plt.clf() between plots in your code so that the plots don’t layer on top of one another.

Let’s get started!
